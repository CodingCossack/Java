Successor with delete. Given a set of n integers S={0,1,...,n−1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:

	•	Remove x from S
	•	Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.

design a data type so that all operations (except construction)  take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
